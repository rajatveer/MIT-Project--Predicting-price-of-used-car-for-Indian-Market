# MIT-Project--Predicting-price-of-used-car-for-Indian-Market
MIT Project to build and compare different regression models and compare against R to predict the best value for used car be performing the following: 
Load libraries
•	Understand the dataset with info and describe 
•	Drop the columns which were not important for further analysis
•	Perform Univariate and Bivariate analysis on Numerical columns
•	Perform feature engineering for missing information
•	Build the following regression model and compare them against R
1.	Linear Regression
2.	Ridge
3.	Lasso
4.	Decision Tree
5.	Random Forest
6.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Decision Tree
7.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Random Forest
8.	KNN
•	Suggested model which can predict the price of used car considering from most significant variables.
